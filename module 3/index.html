			 Bond Of Friendship
		</div>
		<p>
			From the day that I first knew you,
                 <br>Your heart was pure and kind; 
<br>Your smile was sweet and innocent,
<br>Your wit was well refined.
<br>
<br>The sparkle in your eyes was keen,
<br>Your friendship fast and real;
<br>Soft words were your virtue,
<br>And humor your appeal. 
<br>
<br>We grew as friends together,
<br>We laughed and shared our dreams;
<br>Along the way crush or two,
<br>Went unrevealed, it seems. 
<br>
<br>As years rolled on, our paths were split,
<br>Our roads went separate ways;
<br>We each pursued our interests,
<br>That occupied our days.
<br>
<br>We soon forgot our youthful bliss, 
<br>Of tender carefree years;
<br>We didn't talk or keep in touch,
<br>Throughout life's pain and tears.

			If I Could Tell You
		</div>
		<p>
			When I see you in the morning,
<br>it brightens up my day.
<br>There are so many thoughts on my mind,
<br>so many words I want to say.
<br>
<br>I want to tell you how I feel,
 <br>but the words I cannot find.
<br>They're all mixed up with my thoughts
<br>that are running through my mind.
<br>
<br>I've been keeping it locked up
<br>because I know there's not a chance.
<br>You never look my way.
<br>You don't even take a glance.
<br>
<br>You don't even know you're doing this,
<br>toying with my heart.
<br>I wish I could just tell you,
<br>but I don't know where to start.
<br>
<br>Should I tell you how much you mean to me
<br>or how badly I want to be with you?
<br>If I were to say these things
<br>how would you react, what would you do?

			Here For You

			The past you cannot forget or undo;
               <br>The future is all we can look forward to.

               <br>For all the times you've wept and cried.

               <br>Know from my heart what I say is true.
               <br>That I hurt for the pain you have been through.

               <br>Never alone shall you be.
               <br>Someday, freedom you will see.

               <br>May your hopes and dreams come true,
               <br>No matter where you are, I'll always be here for you.
